**Version 1.3, 3 November 2008**

Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

## **PREAMBLE**
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft," which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License to use it for manuals for free software because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

## **APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS**
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document," below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you." You accept the license if you copy, modify, or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public.

A "Opaque" copy means any format whose specification is not publicly available.

## **COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION**
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies.

You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.

## **MODIFICATIONS**
You may modify your copy or copies of the Document, provided that you release the Modified Version under this same License and follow the license’s requirements on crediting the original author.

## **COMBINING DOCUMENTS**
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, ensuring that the combination preserves this License’s terms.

## **TRANSLATION**
Translation is considered a modification, so you may distribute translations under the terms of Section 4, provided that you also include the original English version.

## **TERMINATION**
Your rights under this License will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.

## **FUTURE REVISIONS**
The Free Software Foundation may publish new versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit but may differ in detail to address new concerns.
