## **Assumptions**

- The user has basic knowledge of Linux command-line operations.
- The Ubuntu server is freshly installed and has internet access.
- A separate MySQL database server is available for hosting phpIPAMâ€™s database.
- Proper network access is configured between the phpIPAM application server and the remote MySQL server.
- The deployment will follow security best practices, including firewall configurations, database authentication, and encryption where applicable.
- **Enabling HTTPS is not covered in this instruction set.** However, it is **highly recommended** to deploy an SSL certificate, either locally on the Apache server or using a reverse proxy such as Nginx or Traefik, to secure access to phpIPAM.
## **Prerequisites**

1. **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 or later (recommended)
2. **System Access:** Root or a sudo-enabled user account
3. **Database Server:** A remote MySQL server (MySQL 8.0+ or MariaDB 10.5+)
4. **Required Network Ports:**
    - **Apache Web Server:** TCP port `80` (HTTP) or `443` (HTTPS)
    - **MySQL Remote Access:** TCP port `3306` (ensure it is firewalled and limited to allowed IPs)
5. **Installed Packages:**
    - Apache (`apache2`), PHP (`php` with required extensions), Git, OpenSSL
6. **Security Considerations:**
    - MySQL remote authentication using hashed passwords
    - UFW or iptables configured to allow only trusted sources
    - SSL/TLS enabled for secure web access

# **Installation Steps**
---
## Step 1: Prepare Your Ubuntu System

1. **Update package lists and upgrade installed packages:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```
    
2. **Install essential utilities:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y git curl wget unzip
    ```
 
---
## Step 2: Install Apache, PHP, and Required PHP Extensions

1. **Install Apache:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y apache2
    ```
    
2. **Install PHP and required modules:**
    
    phpIPAM requires PHP along with several modules. Install PHP and these common extensions:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y php php-cli php-common php-gd php-mbstring php-xml php-mysql php-zip php-curl php-gmp php-pear
    ```
    
3. **Restart Apache to load PHP modules:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

## Step 3: Configure Remote MySQL Database with a Hashed Password

### 3.1 Generate a Hashed Password via OpenSSL

On your Ubuntu system, run the following command to generate a SHA-512 hashed password:

```bash
openssl passwd -6 "YourSecurePassword"
```

> **Note:** Copy the resulting hash. You will use it in both the MySQL user creation and later in the phpIPAM configuration.

### 3.2 On the MySQL Server

- **Create a Database for phpIPAM:**
    
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE db_phpipam;
    ```
    
- **Create the phpIPAM User Using the Hashed Password:**
    
    Instead of using the plain text password, store the hash generated by OpenSSL. For example, if using the native MySQL authentication plugin, execute:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE USER 'local_phpipam'@'YOUR_PHPIPAM_SERVER_IP_OR_FQDN' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password AS 'HASHED_PASSWORD';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON phpipam_db.* TO 'local_phpipam'@'YOUR_PHPIPAM_SERVER_IP_OR_FQDN';
    ```

> **Note:** Replace `HASHED_PASSWORD` with the output you obtained from the OpenSSL command, then replace `YOUR_PHPIPAM_SERVER_IP_OR_FQDN` with the address correct address.

### 3.3 Allow Remote Connections

Verify that the MySQL configuration file has the bind address set appropriately and adjust your firewall settings as needed.

1. Open `mysql.cnf` and edit (if necessary).
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
    ```

>     NOTE: By default, the `bind-address = 127.0.0.1` which does not allow any remote access to a MySQL database server.

2. Set the `bind-address` to `0.0.0.0` to allow MySQL to listen on all network interfaces:
    ```conf
    [mysqld]
    bind-address = 0.0.0.0
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> **Security Risks:**
>    1. **Increased Attack Surface:**
>        - By setting `bind-address` to `0.0.0.0` or a specific external IP, MySQL listens on all network interfaces or the specified interface, respectively. This change exposes the MySQL service to external networks, potentially allowing unauthorized access attempts.
>    2. **Potential Misconfigurations:**
>        - Ensuring that only intended IP addresses have access requires meticulous configuration. Any oversight, such as granting privileges to a broader IP range than intended, can inadvertently open access to malicious entities.

## Step 4: Download and Configure phpIPAM

### 4.1 Clone the phpIPAM Repository into Your Web Root

On your Ubuntu system, run the following commands:

```bash
cd /var/www/html
sudo git clone https://github.com/phpipam/phpipam.git
sudo mv phpipam phpipam-app
```

### 4.2 Set Appropriate Ownership and Permissions

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/phpipam-app
sudo find /var/www/html/phpipam-app -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
sudo find /var/www/html/phpipam-app -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```

### 4.3 Copy and Edit the Configuration File

Navigate into the phpIPAM directory, copy the distribution configuration file, and open it for editing:

```bash
cd /var/www/html/phpipam-app
sudo cp config.dist.php config.php
sudo nano config.php
```

Update the database section with your remote MySQL details and the hashed password:

```php
/**
 * Database connection details
 ******************************/
$db['host'] = 'YOUR_MYSQL_SERVER_IP_OR_FQDN';  // Replace with IP or FQDN
$db['user'] = 'local_phpipam';
$db['pass'] = 'HASHED_PASSWORD';  // Replace with hashed password
$db['name'] = 'db_phpipam';
$db['port'] = 3306;
```

Save and exit your editor.

## Step 5: Configure Apache Virtual Host for phpIPAM

1. **Create a New Apache Virtual Host Configuration File:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/phpipam.conf
    ```
    
2. **Insert the following configuration, ensuring the DocumentRoot points to your phpIPAM installation:**
    
    ```apache
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin admin@example.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/phpipam-app
    
        <Directory /var/www/html/phpipam-app>
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
            AllowOverride All
            Require all granted
        </Directory>
    
        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/phpipam_error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/phpipam_access.log combined
    </VirtualHost>
    ```
    
    > **Note:** Replace `admin@example.com` with your actual administrator email.
    
3. **Disable the default Apache site(s) to avoid conflicts:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
    sudo mv /var/www/html/index.html /var/www/html/index.html.bak
    ```
    
4. **Enable the phpIPAM site and required modules:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo a2ensite phpipam.conf
    sudo a2enmod rewrite
    ```
    
5. **Reload or restart Apache:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl reload apache2
    ```

## Step 6: Finalize the phpIPAM Installation via the Web Interface

1. **Browse to your server IP or domain name:**

	Open your web browser and navigate to:

	```html
    http://YOUR_SERVER_IP_OR_FQDN/
    ```

2. **Follow the on-screen installation instructions:**

	The installer will run prerequisite checks, verify database connectivity using the settings in your `config.php`, and guide you through the remaining configuration steps.
	  

3. **Complete the installation:**

    After successfully completing the installer, you should see the phpIPAM dashboard rather than the Apache default page.
