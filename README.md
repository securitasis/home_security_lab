## Current Documentation

| **File**  | **Title** | **Purpose**   |   **Details** |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| [deploy_phpIPAM.md](deploy_phpIPAM.md) | Deploy phpIPAM on Ubuntu & Remote MySQL | A step-by-step guide for securely deploying phpIPAM on an Ubuntu system with a remote MySQL database. | phpIPAM is an open-source IP Address Management (IPAM) platform designed to streamline and automate the administration of IP spaces in modern networks. Written in PHP, it provides a web-based interface for managing IPv4 and IPv6 address pools, subnet allocations, VLANs, and related network resources. Its modular structure, extensive API support, and user-friendly dashboards make phpIPAM a flexible choice for both small-scale deployments and enterprise environments seeking efficient, centralized oversight of critical network assets. | 

## Future Documentation

| **Software / Appliance** | **Purpose**   |   **Details** |

| Ubuquiti UDM Pro Hardware | Configure VLANs and Firewall to isolate IOTs | The Ubiquiti UniFi Dream Machine Pro (UDM Pro) is an all-in-one security gateway designed for small networks, offering advanced features like a firewall, VPN services, and intrusion detection and prevention systems. It also includes deep packet inspection, URL content filtering, and a managed eight-port Gigabit switch, making it a robust solution for protecting network traffic and devices.
| Wazuh | Deploy, configure & integrate | Wazuh is an open-source security platform that provides threat detection, intrusion prevention, and compliance monitoring for small networks. Its capabilities include log data analysis, file integrity monitoring, vulnerability detection, and automated responses to security incidents, making it effective for safeguarding various endpoints and ensuring regulatory compliance.
| Ansible | Deploy & configure | Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool that can help secure small networks by automating tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and security compliance. It allows users to define desired system states and enforce security policies consistently across all devices without needing to install agents on managed nodes, making it efficient and easy to use.
| Nginx | Deploy & configure | NGINX can enhance the security of small networks by acting as a reverse proxy, which helps to shield backend servers from direct exposure to the internet. It also supports SSL/TLS termination, load balancing, and can manage traffic to prevent overload, thereby improving overall network security and performance.
